# Bubblesort-
A data sorting technique called bubble sort copies elements from a larger first array at random into a smaller second array before flipping their order. The sorted data will be found in the centre of the bigger array following several iterations of this operation.

The bubble sort's fundamental principle is to compare each member of an array individually until they are sorted in ascending order, a process known as bubble busting. Instead of shifting the entire array when an element has to be moved, the impacted element is just moved. Because there are fewer updates with this method than with other sorting algorithms, memory is conserved, and overall execution speed is maintained.

1. First Iteration (Compare and Swap)

In order for bubble sort to operate, the things are first sorted into two heaps, and then the elements in each pile are switched around until the objects are sorted in reverse order.This process is known as the First Iteration of Bubble Sort.

a.The first and second components should be switched starting with the first index.

b.If the first element is larger, the first and second elements are exchanged.

c. Right now, compare the second and third things. Swap them if they aren't in the right order.

d. The procedure is carried out till the last component.

2.The following iteration

a.The input item at index 0 is sorted in ascending order during the first iteration of the Bubble Sort, and this procedure is then repeated until all inputs have been sorted. 

b.There would thus be four further iterations of the bubble sort to complete on a dataset with five items after the initial one.
